# =======================================================================================
# Real-time Morse Code Translation System Driven by a BP Neural Network
#
# The system employs a multi-threaded architecture to decouple data acquisition and
# model inference (worker thread) from the main program's command processing and
# translation logic (main thread), ensuring real-time responsiveness.
