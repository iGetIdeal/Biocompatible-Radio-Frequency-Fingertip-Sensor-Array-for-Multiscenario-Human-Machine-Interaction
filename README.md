# Biocompatible-Radio-Frequency-Fingertip-Sensor-Array-for-Multiscenario-Human-Machine-Interaction

This repository serves as the official code appendix for the paper **"Biocompatible Radio Frequency Fingertip Sensor Array for Multi-scenario Human-Machine Interaction"**. It contains the scripts for training the Backpropagation (BP) neural network model, the dataset used, the pre-trained model files, and several proof-of-concept applications demonstrating the model's utility.

## Modules Description

### data/

Contains the dataset used for training the neural network.

- `training_set.xlsx`: The raw data for model training.

### models/

Stores the pre-trained machine learning model and associated data processors.

- `bp_net_model.pth`: The trained PyTorch model weights.
- `scaler.joblib`: The fitted StandardScaler for normalizing input data.
- `label_encoder.joblib`: The fitted LabelEncoder for converting between numerical predictions and class labels.

###  src/

Source code for model training.

- `train_model.py`: The Python script used to train the BP neural network and save the model files.

### applications/

Contains the standalone applications that utilize the trained model.

#### car_game_controller/

A virtual car simulation powered by the BP network.

- `car_game_controller.py`: The main script that reads data, predicts commands, and controls the car in a Pygame window.
- `assets/`: Contains image files for the game.

#### Morse Code Translator

A simple command-line tool for Morse code.

- `morse_code_translator.py`: The script for translation logic.

#### robotic_arm_controller/

A dual-component system for controlling a physical robotic arm.

- `robotic_arm_controller.py`: The Python host script that runs on a PC. It handles model inference and sends control commands via serial communication.
- `stm32_keil_project/`: The embedded firmware for the STM32 microcontroller. This Keil MDK-ARM v5 project receives commands from the host and actuates the arm's motors.

## Installation and Usage

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Keil MDK-ARM (v5 or later) for the embedded project.

### 2. Setup

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```
git clone https://your-repository-url/
cd your-repository-name/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Model Training (Optional)

The repository includes pre-trained models. However, if you wish to retrain the model on your own data, run the training script:

```
python src/train_model.py
```

### 4. Running the Applications

**Virtual Car Controller:**

```
python applications/car_game_controller/car_game_controller.py
```

**Morse Code Translator:**

```
python applications/morse_code_translator/morse_code_translator.py
```

**Robotic Arm Controller:**

1. **Flash Firmware**: Open the `applications/robotic_arm_controller/stm32_keil_project/OpenArmSTM32.uvprojx` project in Keil MDK, compile it, and flash the firmware to your STM32 hardware.

2. Run Host Script

   : Connect the hardware to your PC and run the host controller script. You may need to configure the serial port within the script.

   ```
   python applications/robotic_arm_controller/robotic_arm_controller.py
   ```
