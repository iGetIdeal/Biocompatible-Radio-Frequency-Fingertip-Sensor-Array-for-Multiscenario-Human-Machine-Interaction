# Biocompatible-Radio-Frequency-Fingertip-Sensor-Array-for-Multiscenario-Human-Machine-Interaction

This repository serves as the official code appendix for the paper **"Biocompatible Radio Frequency Fingertip Sensor Array for Multi-scenario Human-Machine Interaction"**. It contains the scripts for training the Backpropagation (BP) neural network model, the dataset used, the pre-trained model files, and several proof-of-concept applications demonstrating the model's utility.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to separate data, models, source code, and applications, ensuring clarity and reproducibility.

- **`/data`**: Contains the dataset (`training_set.xlsx`) used for training and evaluating the model.

- `/models`

  : Contains the pre-trained model files. These are the outputs of the training script.

  - `bp_net_model.pth`: The saved state dictionary of the trained PyTorch neural network.
  - `scaler.joblib`: The saved `StandardScaler` object for normalizing input features.
  - `label_encoder.joblib`: The saved `LabelEncoder` object for handling class labels.

- `/src`

  : Contains the core source code for model training.

  - `train_model.py`: The script to train the BP neural network from scratch using the data in `/data` and save the resulting artifacts into `/models`.

- **`/applications`**: Contains standalone Python scripts that load the pre-trained models from `/models` to perform specific tasks. Each sub-folder represents a distinct application.

## Requirements

**Python Version:** This project requires **Python 3.10 or newer**. This is because the `pygame` library, a core dependency for the `car_game_controller` application, requires a modern version of Python.

**Dependencies:** You will also need the following Python libraries. The `pyserial` package is required for the `robotic_arm_controller`.

You can install all required dependencies using a single `pip` command:

```bash
pip install torch pandas scikit-learn joblib numpy pygame pyserial openpyxl
```

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage these dependencies.

## Usage Guide

This project allows for both re-training the model and running applications with the provided pre-trained models.

### 1. Re-training the Model

If you wish to re-train the model from scratch, you can run the training script.

**Note:** Running this script will overwrite the existing files in the `/models` directory.

From the project root directory, execute the following command:

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

The script will load `data/training_set.xlsx`, train the model, and save the new model, scaler, and encoder to the `/models` directory.

### 2. Running the Applications

The pre-trained models are located in the `/models` directory, allowing you to run the applications directly. Each application script is self-contained and loads the necessary model files.

From the project root directory, run the desired application using one of the following commands:

- **Car Game Controller:**

  ```bash
  python applications/car_game_controller/car_game_controller.py
  ```

- **Morse Code Translator:**

  ```bash
  python applications/morse_code_translator/morse_code_translator.py
  ```

- **Robotic Arm Controller:**

  ```bash
  python applications/robotic_arm_controller/robotic_arm_controller.py
  ```
